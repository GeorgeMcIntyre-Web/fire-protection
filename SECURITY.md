# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Fire Protection Tracker seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@example.com** (replace with actual security contact)

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Measures Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Multi-Layer Authentication
- **Password Requirements**: Enforced strong password policy (minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, special characters)
- **Email Verification**: Required for all new accounts
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeout after inactivity
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **MFA Ready**: Multi-factor authentication infrastructure in place

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Manager**: Project and team management
- **Technician**: Field work and time logging
- **Read-Only**: View-only access for reporting

### Database Security

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All database tables protected with RLS policies
- Role-based data access restrictions
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Secure storage policies for file uploads

#### Data Protection
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- All API requests use secure authentication
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- Input validation on all user inputs

### Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Implemented Protections
- **XSS Prevention**: HTML sanitization on all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input validation
- **File Upload Security**: Type, size, and content validation
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based request validation

#### Validation Coverage
- Email addresses (RFC 5322 compliant)
- Password strength (OWASP guidelines)
- Phone numbers (international format)
- URLs (protocol and domain validation)
- File uploads (type, size, name validation)
- UUIDs (format validation)
- Dates (range and format validation)

### Rate Limiting

Rate limits are enforced for:
- **Login Attempts**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **Password Reset**: 3 attempts per hour
- **Email Verification**: 3 attempts per 10 minutes
- **API Requests**: 100 requests per minute
- **File Uploads**: 10 uploads per hour
- **Search Queries**: 30 searches per minute

### Network Security

- All connections use HTTPS in production
- Secure headers configured (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- CORS properly configured
- No sensitive data in URLs or logs

### Code Security

#### Security Best Practices
- No use of `eval()` or `Function()` constructors
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Regular dependency updates
- Security audit script for continuous monitoring

#### Dependency Management
- Regular `npm audit` checks
- Automated dependency updates
- Version pinning for reproducible builds
- Review of all new dependencies

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- Comprehensive security test suite
- Input validation tests
- RBAC permission tests
- Rate limiting tests
- XSS and injection prevention tests

### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing recommended quarterly
- Security code reviews for critical changes
- Third-party security audits annually

### Running Security Tests

```bash
# Run all security tests
npm run test:security

# Run security audit
npm run security-audit

# Check dependencies
npm audit
```

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence and logs
   - Notify security team immediately
   - Document timeline of events

2. **Investigation**
   - Identify scope of breach
   - Determine attack vector
   - Assess data exposure
   - Review audit logs

3. **Remediation**
   - Patch vulnerability
   - Reset compromised credentials
   - Update security measures
   - Deploy fixes

4. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Report to authorities if required
   - Public disclosure (if appropriate)
   - Post-incident review

### Contact Information

- **Security Team**: security@example.com
- **Emergency Contact**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX
