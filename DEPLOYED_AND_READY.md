## 📋 Next Steps to Make It Fully Functional

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables (5 minutes)

Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com → Pages → fire-protection-tracker → Settings

**Add these variables:**

**VITE_SUPABASE_URL**
```
Your Supabase project URL
Example: https://xxxxxx.supabase.co
```

**VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY**
```
Your Supabase anon key
Find in: Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
```

**How to add:**
1. Click "Add variable"
2. Name: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
3. Value: your Supabase URL
4. Click "Save"
5. Repeat for `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

**After adding, redeploy:**
- Go to "Deployments" tab
- Click "Retry deployment" on latest deployment

### Step 2: Run SQL Migration (5 minutes)

**In Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "SQL Editor"
4. Open file: `supabase-documents.sql`
5. Copy entire contents
6. Paste in SQL Editor
7. Click "Run"

This creates:
- Document categories (9 categories)
- Document library table
- Storage buckets
- Security policies

**Verify:**
- Tables tab → Should see `document_categories` and `document_library`
- Storage tab → Should see buckets created

---

### Step 3: Upload Your Documents (10 minutes)

**In terminal:**
```bash
npm run upload-docs
```

This uploads all documents from `FirePm/QuintensDocs/` to Supabase.

**You'll see:**
```
Uploading: Work Appointment Schedule.xlsx
Uploading: Pressure Test Checklist.xlsx
...
Success: 47 documents uploaded
```

**Verify:**
- In app → Work Documentation → Company Documents tab
- You should see all your documents organized by category
