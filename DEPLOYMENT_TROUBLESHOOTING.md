# üîç **Troubleshooting "Nothing Here Yet"**

## **What's Happening:**
You're seeing "There is nothing here yet" because:
1. The deployment might still be building (takes 2-3 minutes)
2. The project might not be properly connected to your GitHub repo
3. Build might have failed

## **‚úÖ Quick Fixes:**

### **1. Check Deployment Status in Dashboard**
- Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
- Navigate to: **Workers & Pages** ‚Üí **fire-protection**
- Click on the **Deployments** tab
- Check if there's a deployment in progress or if it failed

### **2. If Build Failed:**
- Click on the failed deployment
- View the build logs
- Check for errors
- Common issues:
  - Missing dependencies
  - Build command errors
  - Environment variable issues

### **3. Retry or Create New Deployment**
- If build failed: Click **Retry deployment**
- Or manually trigger a new deployment

### **4. Verify GitHub Connection**
- Make sure your GitHub repo is properly connected
- Check that the branch is set to `main` or `master`
- Verify the build output directory is `dist`

### **5. Manual Upload (If Git Connection Fails)**
If the Git connection isn't working:
1. Go to your local `dist` folder
2. Zip it up
3. In Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üí **Upload** tab
4. Upload the zip file

## **Expected URL:**
Once deployed, your app should be at:
- `https://fire-protection.pages.dev`
- NOT: `fire-protection.fractalnexustech.workers.dev` (that's wrong)

## **Next Steps:**
1. Check the Deployments tab in Cloudflare Dashboard
2. See if a deployment is in progress
3. If failed, check the logs and retry
4. Make sure you're visiting the correct URL

üöÄ **Your app is almost there!**
