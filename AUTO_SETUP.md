## 🎯 What We Need to Do Now

### **1. Get Supabase Credentials** (2 minutes)

**You need to provide these:**

Where to find:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project (or create new one)
3. Click: Settings (gear icon)
4. Click: API

**Copy these 2 values:**
```
Project URL: https://xxxxx.supabase.co
anon public key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Give me these values** and I'll configure everything!

---

### **2. Run SQL Migration** (After you provide credentials)

I can't run this for you (need Supabase access), but here's what to do:

**Option A: I guide you through it** (recommended)
**Option B: You run it yourself** (copy-paste ready)

---

### **3. Upload Documents** (After SQL migration)

I can run this for you! Just need Supabase credentials first.

---

## 🔧 Quick Setup Commands

### **Once you give me Supabase credentials, I'll:**

```bash
# 1. Add to .env
echo "VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-url" >> .env
echo "VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key" >> .env

# 2. Add to Cloudflare Pages
# (I'll give you instructions)

# 3. Upload documents
npm run upload-docs

# 4. Test
npm run dev
```

## 📋 What You Need to Do

**Right now, I need:**

1. **Supabase Project URL**
   - Format: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`

   - Format: `eyJhbG...` (long string)

**Paste them here and I'll configure everything!**

Or if you already have Supabase setup, tell me:
