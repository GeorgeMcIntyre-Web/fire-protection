## 🎯 **Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)**

### **1. Set Up Production Environment Variables** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Why:** App needs real Supabase connection to work fully

**Steps:**
1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Navigate to: **Workers & Pages** → **fire-protection-tracker** → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add these variables for **Production**:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL = your-production-supabase-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your-production-anon-key
   ```
4. Click **Save**
5. Redeploy (or it will auto-deploy)

**Where to get values:**
- Go to your Supabase Dashboard
- Project Settings → API
- Copy "Project URL" and "anon public" key

### **2. Get a Custom Domain** 🟡 IMPORTANT
**Time:** 15-30 minutes  
**Why:** Professional branding and easier sharing

**Recommended:** `fireguardpro.com` (see `DOMAIN_SUGGESTIONS.md` for all options)

**Steps:**
1. Register domain (Cloudflare Registrar recommended for easy setup)
2. In Cloudflare Pages → **Custom domains** → **Add domain**
3. Follow DNS setup instructions
4. Wait for SSL certificate (automatic, ~5 minutes)

**Benefits:**
- Professional URL (e.g., `fireguardpro.com` instead of long Cloudflare URL)
- Better branding
- Easier to remember

---

### **3. Complete Database Setup** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Why:** App needs database tables and structure

**Steps:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **SQL Editor**
2. Run your database migration scripts:
   - `supabase-complete-setup.sql` (if you have it)
   - Or run individual SQL files as needed
3. Verify tables created:
   - `profiles`
   - `projects`
   - `tasks`
   - `clients`
   - `time_logs`
   - `work_documentation`
   - `documents` / `document_library`
   - etc.
4. Verify RLS policies are active

---

### **4. Upload Documents** 🟡 IMPORTANT
**Time:** 15-30 minutes (depending on number of documents)  
**Why:** Document library needs content

**Steps:**
1. Prepare documents in appropriate folders
2. Run upload script:
   ```bash
   npm run upload-docs
   ```
3. Verify in Supabase Storage
4. Test document library in app

---

### **5. Test Everything End-to-End** 🟡 IMPORTANT
**Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Why:** Ensure all features work with real data

**Test Checklist:**

- [ ] Create a project
- [ ] Add tasks to project
- [ ] Log time entries

---

### **6. Configure Storage Buckets** 🟡 IMPORTANT
**Time:** 10 minutes  
**Why:** Documents need storage space

**Steps:**
1. Supabase Dashboard → **Storage**
2. Create buckets:
   - `company-documents`
   - `project-documents`
   - `forms` (optional)
   - `certificates` (optional)
3. Set public/private access as needed
4. Configure RLS policies for each bucket
