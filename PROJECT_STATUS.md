## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Recent Decisions
1. **Use Vitest over Jest** - Better Vite integration, faster
2. **Error boundaries for resilience** - Prevent full app crashes
3. **Centralized error handling** - Consistent UX, easier maintenance
4. **Validate env on startup** - Fail fast with clear messages

### Open Questions
1. Should we add Sentry for error tracking? (Deferred to Phase 5)
2. Which features to test first? (Core business logic: pm-workflow, project-planning)
3. Auto-deploy on every commit? (Yes, but with CI checks)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What's Working Well
- TypeScript catches bugs early
- Demo mode is valuable for testing
- Component organization is clean
- Tailwind CSS speeds up development
- Cloudflare Pages deployment is smooth

### What Could Be Better
- Should have added tests from day 1
- Should have CI/CD earlier
- Could use more code comments
- Could benefit from design system

### For Next Time
- Setup testing infrastructure first
- Add CI/CD in first sprint
- Document as you go (not after)
- Regular code reviews (weekly)
