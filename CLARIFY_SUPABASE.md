# 🔍 Clarification Needed

I received your key, but need a few details to complete setup:

## ✅ What I Have

- Key: `sbp_d66ab145246ed64870f46ecda17092166f393f55`
- Key saved to .env file

## ❓ What I Need From You

### **1. Is this a Supabase project?**

The key format suggests Stytch/Ballerine. Are you using:
- Supabase (what we designed for) 
- OR a different authentication service?

### **2. Your Project URL**

I need your **Supabase Project URL** which looks like:
```
https://xxxxx.supabase.co
```

**Where to find it:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Settings → API
4. Copy "Project URL"

### **3. Current Setup**

**Option A:** If you're using Supabase:
- I need the Project URL from Supabase Dashboard
- Then I'll configure everything

**Option B:** If you're using a different service:
- Tell me which service (Stytch, Ballerine, etc.)
- I'll adapt the setup

---

## 🎯 What I Can Do Now

**Tell me:**
1. Do you have a Supabase project? (Yes/No)
2. If yes, what's the URL? (`https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
3. If no, do you want to create one or use something else?

**With those answers, I can complete the setup immediately!** 🚀
