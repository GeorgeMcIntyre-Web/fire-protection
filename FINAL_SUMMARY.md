## 🎯 Areas Where You Need Help - SOLVED

### 1. **Better Structure** ✅

**Solution:** Structured Project Planning System
- **File:** `src/lib/project-planning.ts`
- **What it does:**
  - Breaks projects into clear phases
  - Each phase has specific tasks
  - Shows dependencies (must complete Phase 1 before Phase 2)
  - Clear, logical flow

**Example:**
```
📋 PROJECT: Sprinkler System

Phase 1: Planning & Design
  ✓ Site Survey (4 hours)
  ✓ System Design (8 hours)
  ✓ ASIB Submission (2 hours)

Phase 2: Procurement & Fabrication
  ✓ Order Materials
  ✓ Fabricate Pipework
  ✓ Create Brackets

Phase 3: Installation
  → Install Pipes (32 hours)
  → Install Sprinkler Heads
  → Install Valves

Phase 4: Testing & Commissioning
  → Pressure Test
  → Commission System
  → Final Documentation
```

**Benefits:**
- Never miss a step
- Can't skip dependencies
- Clear what comes next
- Follow in order

### 2. **Planning Better** ✅

**Solution:** Daily Workflow Dashboard
- **File:** `src/components/PMDashboard.tsx`
- **What it shows:**
  - Urgent tasks (red badges)
  - Today's work (blue badges)
  - Client updates needed
  - Documentation status

**How to use:**

```

### 3. **Money & Budgeting** ✅

**Solution:** Budget Tracker Dashboard
- **File:** `src/components/BudgetTracker.tsx`
- **What it shows:**
  - Estimated vs actual costs per project
  - Variance (over/under budget)
  - Status indicators (green/yellow/red)
  - Overall budget summary

**What you'll see:**

```
💰 BUDGET OVERVIEW

Total Estimated: R 250,000
Total Actual:     R 245,000
Variance:         -R 5,000 ✓ (saving money!)

├─ Actual:    R 110,000 ✓
├─ Variance:  -R 10,000 (under budget!)
└─ Status: "On track"
```

**Alerts you'll get:**
- 🟢 Green = On budget
- 🟡 Yellow = At risk (watch closely)
- 🔴 Red = Over budget (take action)

**Budget Tips (Built-in):**
