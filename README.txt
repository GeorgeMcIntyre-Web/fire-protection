What You Need Right Now
=======================

You gave me a key: sbp_d66ab145246ed64870f46ecda17092166f393f55

BUT I need SUPABASE credentials, not Stytch.

Get These From Supabase:
--------------------------
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Create/select project
3. Settings â†’ API
4. Copy these 2 things:
   - Project URL (looks like: https://xxxxx.supabase.co)
   - anon public key (starts with: eyJhbGci...)

Then Give Me:
--------------
Your Supabase URL and anon key so I can complete the setup!

OR I can guide you through it step-by-step. Your choice!
