```

#### Actions:
1. **Acknowledge** the incident
2. **Assess** severity level
3. **Create** incident ticket/channel
4. **Notify** appropriate team members
5. **Begin** initial investigation

### 3. Investigation (First 30 minutes)

#### Gather Information:
```bash
# Check application status
curl -I https://fire-protection-tracker.pages.dev

# Check recent deployments
# GitHub: Actions > Recent runs

# Check error logs
# Browser console
# Supabase logs

# Check metrics
# Cloudflare Analytics
# Supabase Dashboard
```

#### Questions to Answer:
- What is the current impact?
- How many users affected?
- When did it start?
- What changed recently?
- Is data at risk?

### 4. Mitigation

#### Immediate Actions (SEV-1/2):

1. **Rollback** (if deployment-related)
   ```bash
   # See ROLLBACK_PROCEDURES.md
   # Option 1: Cloudflare Dashboard rollback
   # Option 2: Git revert + redeploy
   ```

2. **Disable Feature** (if feature-specific)
   - Feature flag toggle
   - Environment variable change
   - Code hotfix

3. **Scale Resources** (if capacity-related)
   - Upgrade Supabase plan
   - Optimize queries
   - Enable caching

4. **Block Traffic** (if security-related)
